## Description

In this project, we compare and evaluate the performances of CycleGAN, StarGAN v1 and StarGAN v2 on unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. While all of them perform well, CycleGAN has the limitation of being only capable of learning the relations between two different domains at a time. Both StarGANs are more efficient by being able to train and test over multiple domains simultaneously. Compared with the other two models, StarGAN v2 generates images that are closer to real works. What's more, it also brings diversity in styles of the images.
